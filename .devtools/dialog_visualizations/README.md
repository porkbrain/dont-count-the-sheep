We generate `.png`s with graphviz for each dialog `.toml` in the assets directory and store those `.png`s in this directory.
The `.png`s are not checked in to the repository.

Use the following command to generate the `.png`s and watch for changes to the `.toml`s:

```bash
./dev/visualize_dialog
```
