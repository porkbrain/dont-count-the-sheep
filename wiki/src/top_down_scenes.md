# Top down scenes

Top-down scenes are the main kind of scenes in our game.
The player can move their character around the scene, interact with objects, and talk to NPCs.

## TODO

- [ ] Add crow animation.
      A new atlas is up in the game files, 1 idle, 2 kvak, 3+4 flight, 4+5 zobani, 6+7 walking
      Maybe the triggering of fly away animation when player is close but also we could do a little thing where you leave out shinies for him and after a certain amount he doesn't fly away and thanks you for the shinies.
- [ ] Add scooter.
      Bottom line of winnie's atlas has scooter animation, environment asset folder has scooter scooter.
- [ ] Mirror needs to mirror.
- [ ] Butterfly needs animation.
      Added a butterfly to a tree, the first two frames should repeat until interrupted, then we have two directions of flight, need a randomized route.
- [ ] Make seats sittable. n14 in winnies atlas for animation. Assign sittable to
