## White Cat

White cat is a character endemic to the mall.
It roams the mall.

In Godot, the mall scene has a special node name pattern: `WhiteCatPatrolPoint*`.
If a `Node2D`'s name starts with `WhiteCatPatrolPoint` it will be considered a patrol point for the white cat character and the cat will randomly walk between all the patrol points in the scene.

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out opening hours
- [ ] Add self-checkout UI. There's a scene that can be used to open it.
