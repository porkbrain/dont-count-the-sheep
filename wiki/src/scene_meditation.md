The first version of the meditation mini-game used a static background in which Hoshi, the main character, moved.
The goal was to destroy Polpos, little TVs with tentacles, by staying near them.
This version was not fun to play and we lacked ideas on how to improve it.

The second version re-uses much of the code and art of the first one.
Now, Hoshi is a falling star on a vertically scrollable background.
The goal is to collect crystals on the way down.
The limited resource is the jump, therefore the player must plan their path to collect more crystals.

# TODO
